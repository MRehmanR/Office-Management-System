    Abstract / Introduction
The main theme of the office management system is to provide its clients with a mechanism using
which office operations can be automated with a computer program. The management system
will store all the data as it is done in databases for manual file keeping. Due to automation
property, manual and paperwork will be decreased. According to a survey conducted most the
offices lack the management systems due to which many of the problems have arisen such as
resource wastage, extra manpower usage, manual file handling. Using this system, the
administrator would be able to manage its staff by managing the attendance, tasks, progress,
leaves, and many more things. On the other side, the staff would be able to manage its profile,
view its progress and tasks, apply for leave and launch a complaint.
